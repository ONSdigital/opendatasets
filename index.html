	<h2>ONS Tabular Data Package - a pilot </h2>
	<p>The Open Datasets team within the Office for National Statistics (ONS) are pleased to be posting a pilot data package on Github. The first package contains data from the Measuring National Well-being Programme using Personal Well-being data collected between April 2012 and March 2013 on the Annual Population Survey.<br>
		The data package has been built in accordance to the <a href="http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/#tabular-data">Tabular Data Package specification.</a> This data has been released on the ONS website and we have, with the permission of the Personal Well-being team, re-used this for the purposes of producing data in a true CSV format. This is a pilot intended for demonstration purposes only to see whether and how providing information in this format can be of value to users. </p>
<p>
Our primary aim is to understand whether this format provides utility. We would welcome any views from the community that could help identify improvements. Where appropriate we will use this feedback to produce further iterations, for this pilot we will collect feedback via the <a href="https://github.com/ONSdigital/opendatasets/issues">GitHub Issues page</a></p>
