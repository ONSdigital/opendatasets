	<h2>Open Datasets</h2>
	<p>The Open Datasets team within the Office for National Statistics (ONS) are pleased to be posting a pilot data package on Github. The first package contains data from the 2011 National Wellbeing Programme using data collected byt the annual population survey.<br>
		The data package has been built in accordance to the <a href="http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/#tabular-data">Tabular Data Package specification.</a> This data has been released on the ONS website and we have, with the permission of the National Wellbeing team, re-used this for the purposes of producing data in a true CSV format. Please be aware that we are piloting this data package format. The ONS has no intention of producing updates to the data in this package. Also, it should not been seen as an intention for the ONS to release other data in this format. 

Our primary aim is to understand whether this format provide utility. We would welcome any views from the community that could help identify improvements. Where appropriate we will use this feedback to produce further iterations. </p>
